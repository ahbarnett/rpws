## Description

These codes evaluates on a regular square (_d_=2) or cubical (_d_=3)
grid of points
a real-valued function _u_ drawn at random from a certain Gaussian random field
with zero mean, unit variance, and an isotropic
(radially symmetric) autocorrelation function.
There are two cases:

- alpha=1: "monochromatic" random plane waves.
_u_ is the real part of the
Fourier transform of Gaussian white noise living on the unit circle
or sphere.
This is M. V. Berry's 1977 model for chaotic eigenfunctions.
In other words,

![u(\mathbf{x}) = \mbox{Re } \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j e^{i\mathbf{n}_j \cdot \mathbf x}~,  \qquad \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d, \quad \mathbf{n}_j \in S^{d-1}, \quad a_j \in \mathbb{C}](doc/rpw.png)

where for each _j_, _a<sub>j</sub>_ is iid random from a complex Gaussian
(ie real and imaginary parts are iid Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance),
and **n**<sub>_j_</sub> is iid uniformly randomly drawn from the unit circle
or sphere with the usual Haar measure.
In terms of distance _r_, the autocorrelation function of _u_
is the _J_<sub>0</sub>(_r_) Bessel function in 2D,
or the spherical Bessel _j_<sub>0</sub>(_r_) = sin(_r_)/_r_ in 3D.

- alpha=0: "Fubini-Study ensemble". _u_ is the real part of the
Fourier transform of Gaussian white noise uniformly filling the unit disc or
ball.
This is locally the same as a random homogeneous polynomial evaluated
on the unit sphere _S<sup>d</sup>_, in the limit of large degree (zooming
in to a patch of the sphere it becomes Euclidean space).
Its autocorrelation function has faster decay
than for alpha=1, although it is still oscillatory.


## Basic usage

From either MATLAB or octave:

- `[u x] = rpw2dnufft(M, ppw, alpha);` outputs a 2D `M`-by-`M` grid of function values
`u` at the coordinates given by `x` along both axes, with `ppw` grid points per wavelength. `alpha` is 0 or 1 as described above.

- `[u x] = rpw3dnufft(M, ppw, alpha);` outputs a 3D `M`-by-`M`-by-`M` grid of function values
`u` at the coordinates given by `x` along all three axes, with `ppw` grid points per wavelength. `alpha` is 0 or 1 as described above.

See the MATLAB help documentation for these two functions for more options,
and timing information.
